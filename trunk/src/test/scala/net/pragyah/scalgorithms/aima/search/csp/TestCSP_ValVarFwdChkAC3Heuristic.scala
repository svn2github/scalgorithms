/*
 * This one makes the use of all the other heuristics (MRV+DegreeHeuristic + LeastConstrainingValueHeuristic + ForwardCheck)
 * Along with a strategy for constraint propagation - AC3  (ac3 is 2-consistency form  :  k-consistency -> k = 2)
 * ForwardCheck heuristic does not detect all the inconsistency because it does not look far enough ahead ... 
 * in that removal of values from the domains of two adjoining variables (of the current variable) may violate 
 * the constraints in which they participate with their adjoining variables respectively.
 * AC3 propagets the constraints further
 * This would be applied as a preprocessing step ... wherein ... after ForwardChecking is done and before new variable is to be selected for assignment
